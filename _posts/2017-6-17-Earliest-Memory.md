title: Earliest Memory
--- 

My earliest memory would have to be when I had my 15. I had a lot of fun and enjoyed that day very much. My friends went and we danced and ate a lot of food, before getting to the ballroom we wont out into Downtown Dallas and took pictures. My friend almost fainted because it was really hot that day. My cousins also went with us and we goofed around and took us out to eat.
